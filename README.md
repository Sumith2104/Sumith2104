## 🧠 About Me

I'm a curious and self-driven tech enthusiast from Karnataka 🇮🇳. I started my journey in programming during my diploma, where I discovered my passion for coding by winning a coding challenge 🏆. Since then, I’ve built multiple real-world projects ranging from bill generators to AI-powered applications.

Currently, I’m diving deep into **Data Science** while expanding my knowledge in **C programming** for core computer science fundamentals. I'm also exploring **freelancing**, project management, and full-stack development.
